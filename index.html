<h1>Prices of homes are soaring. Is the end upon us?</h1>

<h2>Why is the topic of homes so close to our hearts?</h2>

<p> 80% of the population resides in HDBs in Singapore. While HDB was birthed as a social policy to provide affordable 
    housing to Singapore Citizens/Permanent Residents, opportunistic flat owners have been rapidly selling BTO-es once 
    MOP has been reached for a windfall capital gain. These data visualizations seek to shed light on what the market has 
    been up to recently. </p>

<div id="rectchart"></div>

<p>The Minimum Occupation Period(MOP) for HDB flats was introduced to curtail the rapid selling of HDB flats by individuals 
  seeking to make a quick profit. Today, the MOP for resale flats is five years, meaning that flat owners that bought their 
  flats from HDB will have to occupy the flat for five years before it can be sold on the resale market.
  <a href="https://www.hdb.gov.sg/residential/selling-a-flat/eligibility" title="W3.CSS" target="_blank" class="w3-hover-text-green">More info here</a>
  
  Using transaction data from Jan 2017 to Dec 2022, we analyze flats with a remaining lease period of 90 years and above. 
  These flats would have recently fulfilled the MOP requirement before the flat can be sold on the resale market and would 
  be the first resale transaction of the flat in the open market (before the next 5-year MOP is reached). 
  
  This data story is relevant to those seeking to purchase first-generation resale flats, which still bear many similarities 
  to BTO flats except that these potential buyers need not wait for the project to be built. The visualizations may be 
  especially relevant to young couples who are looking for resale flats with a lease to comfortably cover their lifetime. </p>

<h2>Recent trends in the resale market</h2>

<p>Despite our average household income increasing year-on-year, when compared to the rise in resale prices of recently MOP 
  flats, our relative purchasing power is diminished. </p>
  
<p>Prices arenâ€™t just increasing, but the flat sizes have been decreasing. Resultantly, the cost of purchasing a square metre 
  of property has been increasing over time across the areas in Singapore. Of interest is Central area and Bishan, where no 
  sale of MOPs have taken place since 2006 as there have been no new BTO projects at those mature estates in the past decade.</p>

<h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>

<p>First-generation resale flats are a great choice for those looking for a young flat. As opposed to new BTO flats, it does not require 
  balloting or a long waiting time. </p>
